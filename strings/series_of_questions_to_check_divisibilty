To check divisibility of large numbers which can't be stored as numbers, we use strings
Check divisibility by -

2- last digit divisible by 2
3- Sum of digits divisible by 3
4- last two digits divisible by 4
5- last digit 5 or 0
6- divisible by 2 and 3 both
7- alternate sub and addition of series of 3 digits divisible by 7
    e.g. Input : 8955795758
    Output : Divisible by 7
       Explanation:
       We express the number in terms of triplets 
       of digits as follows.
                (008)(955)(795)(758)
       Now, 758- 795 + 955 - 8 = 910, which is 
       divisible by 7

8- last 3 digits divisible by 8
9- sum of digits divisible by 9
10- last digit 0
11- difference of sum of digits at odd places and sum of digits at even places divisible by 11
    e.g.For example, let us consider 76945 
    Sum of digits at odd places  : 7 + 9 + 5
    Sum of digits at even places : 6 + 4 
    Difference of two sums = 21 - 10 = 11
    Since difference is divisible by 11, the
    number 7945 is divisible by 11.

12- divisible by 3 and 4
13- alternative sum and diff of 3 digits divisible by 13. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-large-number-divisible-13-not/
16- last 4 digits divisible by 16

19- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-any-large-number-is-divisible-by-19-or-not/
20- divisible by 5 and 4
25- last 2 digits 0 or divisible by 25
75- divisible by 3 and 25 both
999- sum of 3 digits groups divisible by 999
